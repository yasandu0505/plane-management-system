# Private Plane Seat Reservation System

## Overview
A new company managing a private plane has tasked you with developing a **Java program** to efficiently manage and track seat reservations. This assignment involves designing and implementing a system that allows users to reserve seats, check availability, and track reservations based on seat pricing.

## Aircraft Layout
The plane consists of **four rows of seats** labeled **A, B, C, and D**. Each row has a different number of seats, either **12 or 14 seats**. Seats are uniquely identified using a combination of their row letter and seat number (e.g., **B2**).

### Seat Pricing
Seats are categorized into different price ranges based on their location in the aircraft:
- **Yellow seats** cost **£200**
- **Blue seats** cost **£150**
- **Green seats** cost **£180**

For example, in the provided seating chart, **seat B2 is marked with an 'X' and costs £200**.

## Features of the Java Program
- **Seat Reservation System:** Users can select and reserve seats.
- **Availability Check:** Users can view available and occupied seats.
- **Pricing Display:** Seat prices are shown based on the assigned colors.
- **Dynamic Seating Arrangement:** The program manages different seat layouts for different rows.

## How to Run the Program
1. **Clone the Repository** (if using GitHub):
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yasandu0505/plane-management-system.git
   ```
2. **Open in IntelliJ IDEA** (or any Java-supported IDE).
3. **Run the Main Class** to start the seat reservation system.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** (Core programming language)
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (Development environment)
- **GitHub** (Version control & repository hosting)

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing a **graphical user interface (GUI)** for better user interaction.
- Adding a **payment processing system** to finalize reservations.
- Integrating a **database** to store reservation data persistently.
